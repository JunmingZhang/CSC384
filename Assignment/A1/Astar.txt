1.Divide the heuristic result by 1.2 after calculating the heuristic by A*.
  Because to make a heuristic admissible, the estimated heuristic should be
  less than the cost of an optimal path from the node to a goal node. If the
  heuristic is underestimated by 20%, it is definitely less than the real
  cost even before division. However, if it is overestimated to goal by 20%,
  to guarantee the admissibility, the division makes even the maximum of the
  heuristic equal to the real cost.

2.False, because the sum of Manhattan distances from three xanadus to the goal
  is inadmissible, because each xanadu more likely to move through multiple
  squares other than one by one square, and this may cause large amount of
  overestimation, however, theoretically speaking heuristic algorithm should
  always underestimate.
